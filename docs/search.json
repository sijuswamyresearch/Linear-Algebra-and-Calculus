Now, we venture into the “curvy” world of calculus, but in higher dimensions.\nIn single-variable calculus, you studied functions \\(y = f(x)\\), whose graphs are curves in a 2D plane. Now, we’ll explore functions of two variables, \\(z = f(x, y)\\).

    "text": "4.2 Partial Derivatives: The Slope in One Direction\nHow do we measure the “slope” of a surface? The problem is that the slope depends on which direction you’re facing!\nThe simplest way to start is to do the simplest thing: hold one variable constant.\n\nImagine you are standing on the surface and decide to walk only in the x-direction (due east). The slope you experience is the partial derivative with respect to x, written as \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\) or \\(f_x\\).\nAlternatively, if you walk only in the y-direction (due north), the slope is the partial derivative with respect to y, written as \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\) or \\(f_y\\).\n\nTo calculate \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\), you simply treat \\(y\\) as a constant and differentiate with respect to \\(x\\).

    "text": "4.5 Local Linear Approximation: The Tangent Plane\nThis is a central idea that connects everything together. Remember from single-variable calculus the Madhava-Taylor series. The first-order approximation of a function \\(f(x)\\) near a point \\(x=a\\) is its tangent line: \\[ L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) \\] This is the local linear approximation. The idea is powerful: if you zoom in far enough on any smooth curve, it looks like a straight line.\nWe will now extend this to two dimensions. If you zoom in far enough on any smooth surface, it looks like a flat plane. This is the tangent plane.\n\nDefinition: Local Linear Approximation The local linear approximation of a function \\(f(x,y)\\) at a point \\((a,b)\\) is given by: \\[ L(x, y) = f(a, b) + f_x(a, b)(x-a) + f_y(a, b)(y-b) \\] The graph of this function, \\(z = L(x,y)\\), is the tangent plane to the surface \\(z = f(x,y)\\) at the point \\((a,b)\\).\n\nThis formula is a beautiful extension of the 1D case. It says the approximate height near \\((a,b)\\) is the starting height \\(f(a,b)\\), plus the change due to moving in x (slope in x times distance in x), plus the change due to moving in y (slope in y times distance in y).\n\n4.5.1 Problem and Application: Estimating Values\nLet’s find the tangent plane for the function \\(f(x,y) = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\) (a cone) at the point \\((3, 4)\\) and use it to approximate \\(f(3.01, 3.99)\\).\n\n\nCode\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbols and the function\nx, y = sp.symbols('x y')\nf = sp.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\na, b = 3, 4\n\n# 1.

    "text": "4.8 Module III Summary\n\nWe’ve moved from 2D curves to 3D surfaces, or “landscapes.”\nPartial derivatives (\\(f_x, f_y\\)) are the slopes in the cardinal directions.\nThe gradient vector (\\(\\nabla f = [f_x, f_y]\\)) packages these slopes and points in the direction of steepest ascent. It is the key to understanding the local geometry of a surface.\nTo find potential maxima and minima (critical points), we find where the landscape is flat by solving \\(\\nabla f = 0\\).\nThe Second Derivative Test, using the determinant of the Hessian matrix, allows us to classify these critical points as local maxima, local minima, or saddle points.\nThis process of finding extrema is called optimization, and it is the absolute core of how modern AI models are trained.",
